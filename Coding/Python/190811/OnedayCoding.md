## Instructions

 Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

> 89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1

> 695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

> 46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p

- we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n.

In other words:

> Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k

If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

**Note**: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.

```python
dig_pow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1
dig_pow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k
dig_pow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
dig_pow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51
```

## Sample Test

```python
test.assert_equals(dig_pow(89, 1), 1)
test.assert_equals(dig_pow(92, 1), -1)
test.assert_equals(dig_pow(46288, 3), 51)
```



## My solution

```python
def dig_pow(n, p):
    k = sum([int(x)**(p+i) for i,x in enumerate(str(n))])/n
    return -1 if k%1 else int(k)
```

## Best Solution

```python
def dig_pow(n, p):
    k, fail = divmod(sum(int(d)**(p + i) for i, d in enumerate(str(n))), n)
    return -1 if fail else k
```
