# Today I Leaned(TIL)

Just saving what I Leaned today

The goal is to update this everyday... maybe

**[2020 Reorganization form of TIL]**
1. Do not abuse for filling commit blocks
2. Upload summarized documents and  project tutorials on Github repository
3. Upload detailed articles and explanation on Notion
4. Do coding as many as possible at least easy one
5. Write just the link what ã…¡I did today, not detail explanation on this repo.  
  
**[2020/02/01 Amended form of TIL]**
1. Since it is too hard for detaching my personal study log with coding and project, commit blocks get messed up with meaningless and unrelated contents
2. Totally reorganize my plan, which is refered to other's daily commit, TIL log

   * [http://milooy.github.io/TIL/](http://milooy.github.io/TIL/)  
   * [https://wayhome25.github.io/](https://wayhome25.github.io/)  
   * [https://github.com/ksu3101/TIL](https://github.com/ksu3101/TIL)  
3. So I decide to stop daily commit and delete all of study log

## Destination
* To be a good developer
* Lasting and continuous learning

## Rules
* **Do not abuse for filling commit blocks** - mostly important, Do meaningful commit
* Upload my study log at Notion, and do not commit for this
* The name of files and folder should be English as well as README.md, but study log on Notion can be Korean
* Write down clearly so that I can understand directly when I see next time
